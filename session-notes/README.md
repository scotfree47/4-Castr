# Session Notes Directory

This directory contains detailed summaries of Claude Code sessions for context preservation across chats.

**Purpose:**
- Maintain full context when approaching 200k token limit
- Enable Claude to reference previous sessions
- Preserve implementation details and decisions

**Structure:**
- Each session = one .md file
- Named: SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md
- Gitignored (not pushed to repo)

**Usage:**
Claude reads these during new sessions to understand:
- What was built
- Why decisions were made
- What patterns to follow
